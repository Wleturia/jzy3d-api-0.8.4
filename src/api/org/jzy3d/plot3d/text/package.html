Provides utilities for rendering texts into a 3 dimensional scene.
<p>
A Text3d is a special primitive that does not implement the Drawable interface. Indeed, an instance
of Text3d renders any number of strings.
<p>
The {@link Text3dBillboard} class allows drawing text as a collection of bitmaps, with a position specified
with a three dimensional coordinate. Note that Text3dBillboard is currently not resizable.
<p>
The {@link Text3dFont} is an attempt to wrap the TextRenderer provided by JOGL but that doesn't
work at version 1.1.1-rc3. It is left in this package for further tests. Note that the TextRenderer
coming with the SWT binding 0.7 neither work.
<p>
Any Text3d has a position given by a (x,y,z) coordinate. Moreover, it is possible to specify an
horizontal or vertical alignment w.r.t. to this position, by using the {@link TextHalign} and 
{@link TextValign} enumerations.
